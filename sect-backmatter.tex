\footnotesize{
NPS's Dudley Knox Library catalogs all publicly releasable theses, technical reports, and MBA professional reports. Therefore, a good source of information about what theses and various reports have been written by NPS faculty and students is the Library's general catalog, BOSUN, accessible at \url{http://www.nps.edu/Library/index.html}. An explanatory page facilitating access to NPS theses can be found at \url{http://www.nps.edu/Library/Services/Special\%20Collections/NPSTheses.html} and the same information applies to many other NPS-produced reports.

Copies of the quarterly NPS publication, \textit{Compilation of Theses Abstracts}, can be found at \url{http://www. nps.edu/Research/index.html}. The annual list of technical reports can be found at \url{http://www.nps.edu/Research/Publications/TechReports.html}. Copies of unclassified theses or other reports that are publicly releasable may be purchased from either of the following agencies depending on the particular circumstances.
